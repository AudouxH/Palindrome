The palidrome is a project which found one or more most closest palindrome for your number
The palidrome is found to take your number, reverse this and add the result at your number

Exemple using :

./palidrome -h
USAGE
./palindrome -n number -p palindrome [-b base] [-imin i] [-imax i]
DESCRIPTION
-n n integer to be transformed (>=0)
-p pal palindromic number to be obtained (incompatible with the -n
option) (>=0)
if defined, all fitting values of n will be output
-b base base in which the procedure will be executed (1<b<=10) [def: 10]
-imin i minimum number of iterations, included (>=0) [def: 0]
-imax i maximum number of iterations, included (>=0) [def: 100]
